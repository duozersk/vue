single-page application -> into one bundle
how to implement code splitting / dynamic components loading/import

Code Splitting by webpack
import() in routes; or in components property of Vue component

router-link-exact-active and router-link-active classes for router links
<router-link tag="li" active-class="active">
exact
exact-active-class

linkActiveClass
linkExactActiveClass
in router configuration object

dynamic routes
path: "/edit/:id"

code logic into methods -> then call method in mounted hook

do not mutate incoming props

v-model === v-bind:value + v-on:input => use v-model on custom components
you can re-define model binding (value) and event (input) on component level

Authorization
Json Web Token - JWT - to not allow load secure data to non authorized users
Protect pages - routes meta data
router has navigational hooks
router.beforeEach()

JSON-server -> POST with id = 0 -> creates new user
